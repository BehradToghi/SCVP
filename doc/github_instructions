For this project, we have not given master branch privileges to everyone.
Therefore, everyone is expected to work on their branches and after testing, we can merge that branch to the master.
Make sure that the branch you create is related to the modification that you are trying to do.

Steps to create a branch on github:
1. Go to Github using https://github.com/CAVREL/SCAVE-CPS
2. Click the branch option and a pop-up menu will appear.
3. In the 'Find or create a branch', just enter the branch name and press Enter.
   Now, you will automatically be in the branch you just created.
